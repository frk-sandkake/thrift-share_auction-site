### Project details:

#### Brief:

An auction site is looking to launch a website where the users themselves
can put up items for auction.  Only registered users can list items and make
bids, but unregistered users can see all the auctionen items. New registered
user are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get more credits by auctioning of items.
<br><br>

#### Requirements:

The project is to build a front-end application that handles the provided API.

**Unregistered user should be able to** view `Listings`, and register with `stud.noroff.no` email.

**Registered users should be able to** log in and log out. Update their avatar. Create a `Listing`, with Title, DeadlineDate, Gallery, and Description. They should also be able to view their total credit, use credit to make a `Bid`, and view `Bids` made on a `Listing`

### My Design:

The target audience is a younger crowd that likes Thrift shops, both finding unique items and supporting charities.

The color palette for my design comes from the logo underneath. It has a vintage feel with the tape cassette.
The colors, in yellow, purple and cyan, are vibrant and playful. Background colors are dark zinc and light amber and 
hopefully gives the visitors and users a calm and warm impression. 

The logo is self-made with the website title "Thrift&Share" in a gradient from the color palette.
